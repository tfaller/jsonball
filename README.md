# JSONball
JSONball is here to trigger actions based on changes of given JSON documents.
It follows an even driven approach, where one change triggers an action that might trigger another change ... like a growing snowball rolling down a hill.
In the end you have a possible large accumulated change across many different documents.

## Why the name
The name is based of the snowball effect. A tiny snowball (or here change) can cause a chain reaction of changes. The little initial
snowball/change can grow to a large one.

I struggled whether I name the project "JSONball" or "JSNOball". I quite like "JSNOball", because JSON has a quite silent "O" and snowball as quite silent "w" (non native speaker, sorry if I'm wrong here). You could read "JSNOball" as "J snoball" or "JSN snoball" -> JSON snowball. But because JSONball and JSNOball are basically typo variants of each other ... I went for JSONball. By the way, try to type "JSNOball" - you will (like I did) most of the time write JSONball. Well, we are devs, we write JSON multiple times a day :) And if we are honest, JSONball sounds nice, as well.
